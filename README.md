This project is based on the original VSCode Portfolio by Nitin Ranganath available here: https://github.com/itsnitinr/vscode-portfolio. I have adapted and extended this code to suit my specific needs and to deepen 
my understanding of Next.js among other technologies.

Through this adaptation, I have familiarized myself with essential aspects of web development such as routing, page layouts, advanced CSS techniques, and app deployment. 
This project has not only helped me to enhance my technical skills but also provided practical experience in deploying live applications and understanding their architecture.
